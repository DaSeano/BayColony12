{"name":"BayColony12","tagline":"The Creation of Dune, a Sol Gov & Nanotrasen partnered Colony on a desert planet. This repo utilises, and will keep in sync with, BayStation12's code base.","body":"# BayColony Edits\r\nAll further BayColony Commits will begin with #BC and then an ascending numeric identifier.\r\nAll edits must be discussed. Major mapped buildings must be publicly posted in the mapping thread for discussion. Approval of content for the first iteration of the map will rest solely with Vetinarix.\r\nWhen the first iteration of the map is complete, BayColony will trend towards a more public approach to decision making.\r\n\r\n# BayColony Branches:\r\n* Master -- will be where BayColony12 Resides\r\n* Dev -- will keep in sync with BS12's dev branch.\r\n* Dev-Freeze -- will be for testing merges between BS12 dev branch code and BayColony12 master code.\r\n\r\n# Mappers\r\nConfer with Vetinarix if you'd like to take up the mantle of mapping any of the following:\r\n* Nanotrasen Research Facility\r\n* Energy & Maintenance Plant\r\n* Cargo & Shuttle Pads\r\n* Sub-Colony Tunnels (Only once all above ground areas are complete)\r\n* Planet Environment (Complete implementation will rely on animals and terrains/oases that don't yet exist)\r\n\r\n# Spriters\r\nWithin reason, you'll have a lot of leeway with these tasks:\r\n* Planetary Fauna (Think lizards and snakes, but also herd animals for hunting, and maybe some lion/gazelle/zebra equivalents. Walking cacti?)\r\n* Planetary Flora (Don't just give us cactus. Give us cotton monster plants and trees which grow upside down.\r\n* Uniforms for Dune Colony Police Department\r\n* Uniforms for (evil) Nanotrasen Scientists\r\n* Casual Clothes (go nuts) \r\n* Small items that may have NT branding (armor, PDA, etc)\r\n\r\n# Coders\r\nThe following is a (slightly ambiguous) rundown of the major tasks will require coders! Cookies will be presented to amazing people! Consult Vetinarix for detailed requirements and implementation discussion.\r\n* Night/Day cycle (Affecting solar power and default lighting state. The current magic number is a cycle lasting 1.5 hours, but it's up for debate.\r\n* Planetary Atmosphere & Area (Not yet set in stone but: about equal to earth pressure, probably nitrogen based - must still contain a bit of oxygen, whatever its formation is, 60 degrees Celsius, accelerates hunger in humans, and slowly does burn damage across any non-covered parts of the body (hands, head)\r\n* Optimization of any atmosphere code for a large planet area.\r\n* Job System (Round Start/Joinable jobs shrink to the 6 Administration positions and their 5 deputies. Only other available joinable \"job\" is Colonist, which has no access by default. ID Computer must be able custom allocate door access codes (i.e add number 101 to the ID's access).\r\n* Planetary Fauna (Once we've got sprites. Feel free to sprite and code them if you really want your half-ape half-snake oasis monster and don't think anyone else is willing to help you with it)\r\n* Planetary Flora (Once we've got sprites!)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
